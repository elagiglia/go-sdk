# MercadoLibre's Golang SDK [DRAFT - WORK IN PROGRESS]

This is the official GO SDK for MercadoLibre's Platform.

## How do I install it?

You can download the latest build at:
    https://github.com/mercadolibre/go-sdk/archive/master.zip

How do I install it using go:

Just run the following command within your $GOPATH

```bash
go get github.com/mercadolibre/sdk
```

And that's it!

## How do I start using it?

The first thing to do is to instance a ```Client``` object. You'll need to give a ```clientId``` and a ```clientSecret```. You can obtain both after creating your own application. For more information on this please read: [creating an application](http://developers.mercadolibre.com/application-manager/)

```go
client := sdk.NewClient(123456,"client secret")
```
With this instance you can start working on MercadoLibre's APIs.

There are some design considerations worth to mention.
This SDK is just a thin layer on top of an http client to handle all the OAuth WebServer flow for you.


## How do I redirect users to authorize my application?

This is a 2 step process.

First get the link to redirect the user. This is very easy! Just:

```go
client := sdk.NewClient(191151416211796, "qM66avGpv5rcQxNWF4sno5oH7Cjph0I7")
url := client.GetAuthURL(sdk.MLA,"https://www.example.com")
fmt.Printf("url:%s\n", url)
```

This will give you the url to redirect the user. You need to specify a callback url which will be the one that the user will redirected after a successfull authrization process.

Once the user is redirected to your callback url, you'll receive in the query string, a parameter named ```code```. You'll need this for the second part of the process.

```go
authorization, err := client.Authorize("TG-57445a71e4b0744714824b93-19793657","https://www.example.com")

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("err: %s", err.Error())
    return
}

js, err := json.Marshal(authorization)
fmt.Printf("Token:%s\n", js)
```

This will get an ```accessToken``` and a ```refreshToken``` (is case your application has the ```offline_access```) for your application and your user.

At this stage your are ready to make call to the API on behalf of the user.

## Making GET calls

```go
resp, err := client.Get("/users/me", authorization)

if err != nil {
	log.Printf("Error %s\n", err.Error())
}
userInfo, _:= ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
fmt.Printf("response:%s\n", userInfo)

```

## Making POST calls

```go
body :=	"{\"title\":\"Item de test - No Ofertar\",\"category_id\":\"MLA1912\",\"price\":10,\"currency_id\":\"ARS\",\"available_quantity\":1,\"buying_mode\":\"buy_it_now\",\"listing_type_id\":\"bronze\",\"condition\":\"new\",\"description\": \"Item:,  Ray-Ban WAYFARER Gloss Black RB2140 901  Model: RB2140. Size: 50mm. Name: WAYFARER. Color: Gloss Black. Includes Ray-Ban Carrying Case and Cleaning Cloth. New in Box\",\"video_id\": \"YOUTUBE_ID_HERE\",\"warranty\": \"12 months by Ray Ban\",\"pictures\":[{\"source\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ray_Ban_Original_Wayfarer.jpg\"},{\"source\":\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teashades.gif\"}]}"

resp, err = client.Post("/items", authorization, body)

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error %s\n", err.Error())
}
userInfo, _= ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
fmt.Printf("response:%s\n", userInfo)

```
## Making PUT calls

```GO
change := "{\"available_quantity\": 6}"

resp, err = client.Put("/items/" + item.Id, authorization, &change)

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error %s\n", err.Error())
}
userInfo, _= ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
fmt.Printf("response:%s\n", userInfo)
```
## Making DELETE calls

```GO
client := sdk.NewClient(123456,"client secret")
client.Delete("/items/123", authorization)
```

## Community

You can contact us if you have questions using the standard communication channels described in the [developer's site](http://developers-forum.mercadolibre.com/)

## I want to contribute!

That is great! Just fork the project in github. Create a topic branch, write some code, and add some tests for your new code.
You can find some examples by taking a look at the main.go file.

To run the tests run ```make test```.

Thanks for helping!
